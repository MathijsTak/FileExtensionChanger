# File Extension Changer

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for changing file extensions in a specified directory. It was created using Claude-3.5-sonnet, an AI language model, based on user requirements and questions.

## Features

- Change file extensions in a selected directory
- Option to include subdirectories in the process
- Simple and intuitive graphical interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python ChangeFiles.py
   ```

2. The GUI window will appear with the following options:
   - Directory: Enter or browse for the target directory
   - Old Extension: Enter the current file extension (e.g., ".txt")
   - New Extension: Enter the desired new file extension (e.g., ".md")
   - Include Subdirectories: Check this box to process files in subdirectories

3. Click the "Change Extensions" button to start the process

4. A success message will display the number of files changed

## Note

Always make sure to backup your files before running this script, as the file extension changes might be irreversible.
